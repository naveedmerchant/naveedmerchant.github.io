The paper that applies leave-one-out CVBFs to variable selection is finally complete. 

We're looking in to a place to submit it.

The BSCRN R package will be updated later to include code that enables easy computation of ALBs and have it applied to screening.

It's good to see the big project finally have a nice bow placed on it at least, even if it's still a ways away from being easily visible.
