I'm Naveed! I recieved my PhD in Statistics from Texas A&M University in Spring 2022. 

I gained experience teaching and grading at the university, head to the teaching page to look more at that.

My doctoral research as a PhD student involved creating a new two-sample Bayesian Test for checking if two data sets share the same distribution. After this, we generalized applications of the test. We made a faster frequentist analogue of the test, and then applied it to speed up and improve other variable selection. My research interests still in general lie in high-dimensional statistics and methods to speed up computation of other methods. I did collaborative research with the statistics consulting center, the Epidemiology department during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Agrilife department. 
 
I've worked for a variety of companies. I worked as a contractor data scientist for Climate Corportation under Colaberry, a statistician for MAXIS-IT, and was a Research Assistant for General Motors under Texas A&M University. I have experience in dealing with large data (too big to store), spatial data, real time data, and high dimensional data (many variables but few outcomes). 

Here's a table of my skillset:
