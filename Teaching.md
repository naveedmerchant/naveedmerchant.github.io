## Courses Taught
- [STAT 201](https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/course-descriptions/stat/), Fall 2019.
    - An elementary statistics course with the goal of gently introducing sampling, statistical inference, and probabilty concepts to undergraduates.
    - Funnily, a copy of my [ratemyprofessor page for the class](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2531341) is available.
